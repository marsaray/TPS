## Purpose
This is an academic project for a college course. However, the team treated it as though it were a real life product that we were creating for a real consumer. There are several use cases that we will explain in detail in other documentation. I also hope that we could use this project as a great starting off point for people interested in learning the fundamentals of full-stack web development. 
## Website information
